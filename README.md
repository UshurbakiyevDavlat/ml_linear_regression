# Linear regression on python.

Linear regression is supervised kind of learning.

Where:

- x is independent variable (example years_of_experience)
- y is dependent variable (example salaries)

Mathematically, linear regression can be described as a formula:

~~~
Y = a + bx
a - intercept
b - slope/coefficient
~~~

The goal of ML model is to build a best-fitting straight line according to that formula.
